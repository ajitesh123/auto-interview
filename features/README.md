## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features
1. Create a new directory under `features/`
2. Add your main component file (e.g., `FeatureNamePage.tsx`)
3. Create an `index.ts` file for clean exports
4. Update the main `LandingPage.tsx` to include your feature
5. Follow the existing naming conventions and structure

### Component Structure
Each feature component should:
- Be self-contained with its own state management
- Use consistent styling (Tailwind CSS with pink gradients)
- Include proper TypeScript types
- Handle loading and error states
- Be responsive and accessible

### State Management
- Use local state with `useState` for simple features
- Consider `useContext` for shared state between features
- Implement proper error handling and loading states

### Styling
- Follow the established design system
- Use pink gradients (`from-pink-500 to-pink-700`)
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

### API Integration
- Place API calls in separate service files
- Use async/await for better error handling
- Implement proper loading states
- Add error boundaries for better UX

## Team Collaboration

### Parallel Development
- Each developer can work on their assigned feature independently
- Features are isolated to prevent merge conflicts
- Use feature branches for development
- Regular integration testing recommended

### Code Review
- Review feature components before merging
- Ensure consistent code quality and patterns
- Test integration with main landing page
- Verify responsive design and accessibility

### Testing
- Write unit tests for individual components
- Test feature integration with main app
- Verify API integrations work correctly
- Test responsive design across devices

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- User authentication and profiles
- Resume templates and customization
- Advanced job search filters
- Interview scheduling
- Progress tracking and analytics

### Technical Improvements
- State management with Redux/Zustand
- API layer abstraction
- Component library creation
- Performance optimization
- SEO improvements
